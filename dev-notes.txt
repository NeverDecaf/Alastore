#### Extra Notes (for devs)

Alastore 1.x.x worked on linux, 2.x.x is untested
Both use Qt so should work in theory but you may encounter some issues (for example the tray icon wouldn't show up or was misaligned in some distros)

Alastore does not prune the episode database. After 5+ years of use I have yet to notice a performance hit.

It should be possible to "port" Alastore to other RSS feeds or database sites.
Switching from shanaproject to, say, bakabt should be as easy as modifying the rss.py file.
Switching from anidb may prove slightly more difficult but is far from impossible (anidb.py would be a good place to start)

Be careful with anything involving anidb as it is VERY easy to get banned. please use your own anidb udp/http client so alastore's isn't banned as well.
